BLE advertiser android app coded in Kotlin

You can download it, sign in with Google and it starts advertising.

Testing if ble stops:
-pressing sign out button: yes
-pressing switch to off: yes
-closing the app partially: no
-closing the app completely: yes
-turning bluetooth off: this far it seems to depend on the VERSION OF BLUETOOTH on the device
